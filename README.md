of any shipment-related incidents. 
The alert system leverages real-Ɵme data integraƟon with our logisƟcs partners, monitoring factors 
such as delivery delays, damage reports, and unexpected route changes. Upon the detecƟon of any 
anomalies, the system will immediately trigger alerts to the importer, exporter, and the assigned 
agent, providing detailed informaƟon on the nature of the issue and recommended next steps.
