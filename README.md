the in-platform messaging system.
7. Customer Support: Dedicated agent assistance and a knowledge base to address any questions or

customer engagement.

guidance on logistics, compliance, and business strategy.
2. Legal Expertise: An in-house legal team dedicated to managing all paperwork and regulatory 
requirements associated with cross-border transactions.

6. Data Privacy and Security: Stringent data protection protocols and compliance with relevant 
industry standards to ensure the confidentiality of user information.
 Alert System for Shipment Incidents 
To ensure the highest levels of transparency and security for both importers and exporters, our 
platform features a comprehensive alert system designed to promptly notify all parties in the event 
of any shipment-related incidents. 
The alert system leverages real-time data integration with our logistics partners, monitoring factors 
such as delivery delays, damage reports, and unexpected route changes. Upon the detection of any 
anomalies, the system will immediately trigger alerts to the importer, exporter, and the assigned 
agent, providing detailed information on the nature of the issue and recommended next steps.
This proactive approach empowers our clients to stay informed and take swift action to mitigate the 
impact of disruptions, fostering greater trust and accountability within the platform's ecosystem. 
Additionally, the alert system's historical data and reporting capabilities enable our team to identify 
trends, implement preventive measures, and continuously enhance the reliability of our logistics 
network. 
 Shipment Insurance Coverage 
To further safeguard the interests of both importers and exporters, our platform mandates the 
inclusion of comprehensive insurance coverage for all shipments facilitated through our marketplace. 
Upon checkout, users will be required to select and pay for an appropriate insurance plan that aligns 
with the value and complexity of their order. The available options will include:
1. Basic Coverage: Providing protection against common risks such as damage, theft, and delays, with 
a coverage limit of up to $10,000 per shipment. 
2. Premium Coverage: Offering enhanced protection, including coverage for force majeure events 
and specialized handling requirements, with a coverage limit of up to $50,000 per shipment. 
3. Customized Coverage: Tailored insurance plans for high-value or specialized goods, with flexible 
coverage limits and additional riders to address unique business needs.
The insurance fees will be collected as part of the overall transaction cost, with our platform 
retaining a commission on each policy sold. This revenue stream, combined with the commission on 
individual transactions, will establish a sustainable and diversified income model for our global 
import-export platform.
By mandating insurance coverage, we ensure that both importers and exporters are protected 
against financial losses resulting from unforeseen circumstances, fostering a secure and trustworthy 
trading environment. Additionally, the availability of customized insurance options caters to the 
diverse needs of our client base, further strengthening our value proposition.
